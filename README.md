# Portfolio Project

For my portfolio project, I designed an inventory component. This component stores a list of items in a users inventory, as well as information about the quantity of that item in stock, and it's unit price. It can also be used to get additional information about the inventory, such as the total costs of items, total quantity of items, and to determine which items are or are not in the inventory. The src folder contains the interfaces and classes for the kernel and secondary methods, as well as two use cases for the component. The first use case uses three inventory objects as part of a representation for a pizza shop class to demonstrate how the object can be used to model real-world structures such as stores, warehouses, etc. The second involves a shopping trip simulation in the main method to show how inventory can be used to track information. The test folder contains JUnit text fixtures for all of the kernel and secondary methods. The doc folder outlines the process of creating the component, from brainstorming and developing code to finalizing and publishing it.
